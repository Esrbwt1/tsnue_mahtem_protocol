## The Decentralized Content Authenticity & Provenance Protocol

This project aims to build **Tsnu'e-Mahtem**, a universal, decentralized standard and open-source toolkit for cryptographically verifying the origin and integrity of digital content. Our goal is to help restore trust in the digital world in an age of misinformation and AI-generated content.
